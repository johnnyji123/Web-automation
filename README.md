# Web Automation - Selenium Framework: Hotel Data Extraction from Seoul, South Korea
## Overview: In this web automation project, I used Selenium, a robust web automation testing framework, to perform data extraction from hotels in the vibrant city of Seoul, South Korea. 
**Through Selenium's automation, I gathered a wealth of data, providing a comprehensive snapshot of each hotel's pricing, name, rating, and customer reviews.
**The scraped data is transformed into a Pandas DataFrame, offering an intuitive and structured representation of the collected information.
